    - Create new user.
    - Enter a known username such as admin followed by an invalid password for that account.
    - An error message appears letting a user or attacker know that there is infact an account named admin.
    - In this case, all they would have to do is use the nifty built-in password cracker/brute-forcer via the wpscan tool in Kali by using the --wordlist option and feeding it a dictionary text or list file and one of the now known usernames (--username option).
