### 2. User Enumeration <= 4.7.1 (CVE-2017-5487)
  - [X] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: User Enumeration
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.7.2
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough: 
  - [X] Steps to recreate:
    - Create new user(s).
    - Enter a known username such as admin or moderator in my case followed by an invalid password for that account.
    - A detailed error message appears letting a user or attacker know that there is infact an account named admin, moderator, etc.
    - Theoretically, all they would have to do is use the nifty built-in password cracker/brute-forcer via the wpscan tool in Kali by using the --wordlist option and feeding it a dictionary text or list file and one of the now known usernames (--username option).
